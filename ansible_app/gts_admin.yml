# Top level playbook for gts Core
# This is more complicated than MAP, since production and test are two sets of servers
# For MAP, prod and test are both td-tac01
# Option 1 --
#   Include all nodes, and use conditional to run tasks only on hosts of the requested env.
#   Downside is that ansible will have to loop through all nodes. Kind of wasteful
# Option 2--
#   Define a local host, and set env in local host. Then for the actual gts task, set hosts to that env variable
